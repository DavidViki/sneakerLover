Hello, my name is David and I am trying to learn web developing. This is my first project called sneakerLover and the idea for the website is a sneaker store web page.
For the current idea (I am taking it slow, and I hope to expand the functionality and features in the future):
*Navigation bar with the name(logo), categories menu and brands dropdown menu.
*Name(logo) is going to be linked to the home page route.
*Categories menu that is going to bring up the content depending on the category(Men, Women, Kids).
*When clicking on the Brands button, a dropdown menu will appear with a few brands (e.g. Nike, Adidas, Puma, Reebok). When clicking on a chosen brand, the content on the page should change to all the sneakers from the chosen brand, and the background image should be also changed.
*The idea for a home page is a list of articles with new releases.
*The article should be an image, name of the shoe, a little paragraph, price, and a button to go check it out in the store offering.
*The articles for all the other products should be an image, a name and a price. When you click on the product in the list, it should take you to a page about only that one product.


If someone wants to help, I will for sure appreciate it, however I would be even more thankful if someone that does offer help, does it in a way in which I can understand the code and learn something new, not just copy and paste the solution to my problems.
Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a good day.
